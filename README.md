TEC-1 code done in ASM and MINT 
 
Rules of Game-of-Life program

- The program should have a graphical user interface that allows the user to specify the size of the game board, the number of generations to simulate, and the initial state of the game board.
- The program should use a two-dimensional array to represent the game board.
- Each cell on the game board should be represented by a single character.
- The program should allow the user to specify the character that represents a live cell and the character that represents a dead cell.
- The program should display the game board after each generation.
- The program should use the following rules to determine the state of each cell in the next generation:
  - If a cell is alive and has fewer than two live neighbors, it dies of loneliness.
  - If a cell is alive and has more than three live neighbors, it dies of overcrowding.
  - If a cell is alive and has two or three live neighbors, it remains alive.
  - If a cell is dead and has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes alive.
